Anki foreign language decks

### Workflow

**Basic Card Mining**

With `addCards.py` you can mine basic cards by running `python addCards.py Test-Deck`. The final argument can be changed to whichever deck name you would like. You will be prompted for a front and back side.

**Complex Card Mining**

This should be done within Anki itself. This way, you can add more than just a basic front/back, adding supplemental example sentences/media to help reinforce learning in a more contextual way.

**Card Conventions**

- Basic: `[Front, Back]`
- myExamples: `[Front, Back, Examples]`
- mySentences: `[Word, Example, Definition, Translation]`
